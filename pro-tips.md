Booking & Logistics

Book NOW - January is peak season; Il Ngwesi and Saruni properties fill 12+ months ahead

Soft-sided luggage only - 15kg limit on safari planes (laundry available at all lodges)

Money & Costs

Budget $9,000-13,000/person (mid-range) including domestic flights, accommodation, most activities
Bring USD cash for tips ($10-15/day per guide, $5-10/day camp staff)
M-Pesa widely accepted; Nairobi ATMs for KES cash needs
January = 50% lower Mara park fees vs. July-Oct (though you're skipping Mara for hidden gems)

Packing Essentials

Layers critical - Dawn drives can be 10-12°C, midday 30+°C
Neutral colors for safari (khaki, olive, beige - no bright colors)
Good walking shoes for Loita/Matthews hikes
Reef-safe sunscreen for coast (regular sunscreen damages coral)
Headlamp for Chyulu lava tubes if you add that stop
Binoculars (often provided but bring your own quality pair)

Health & Safety

Yellow fever certificate required if coming through endemic countries
Malaria prophylaxis recommended (consult travel doctor 6 weeks before)
Samburu/Northern Kenya = malaria risk; coast = lower risk
Drink bottled water only; lodges provide filtered water
Travel insurance mandatory (including emergency evacuation for remote areas)

Weather Strategy

January = dry season but pack one light rain jacket (rare afternoon showers possible)
Samburu HOT (32°C+) - hydrate constantly
Loita Hills can be muddy from December rains - bring boots with good tread
Coast perfect (28°C, low humidity, calm seas)

Photography

Dawn/dusk golden hours are game drive times - perfect light
Ask permission before photographing people (especially at Il Ngwesi/Maji Moto)
Bring extra batteries - charging not always available during hikes
Dust protection for camera gear essential in Samburu

Maximizing Cultural Experiences

Learn basic Swahili: "Jambo" (hello), "Asante" (thank you), "Karibu" (welcome)
At Il Ngwesi/Maji Moto: engage genuinely, ask questions, skip performative photo ops
Purchase crafts directly from artisan cooperatives at lodges (better prices, direct benefit)
Request school/clinic visits through lodge managers to see conservation impact

Alternative Adjustments

Skip Matthews Range if budget-tight (saves 1 flight + expensive lodge night) - extend Samburu instead
Add Watamu instead of Lamu if you want snorkeling/diving focus (easier access, marine park, turtle sanctuary)
Swap Loita for Hell's Gate if less hiking-inclined (easier day trip from Nairobi, cycling option)

Hidden Gem Within Your Gem

Ask Sarara/Kitich for camel-supported camping expedition deep into Matthews Range - you'll sleep under baobabs with zero other tourists
