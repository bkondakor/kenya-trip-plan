  "fullDescription": "Arabuko Sokoke Forest Reserve, located 110km north of Mombasa and 20km south of Malindi, is the largest and most intact coastal forest remaining in East Africa, covering 420 square kilometers. This biodiversity hotspot hosts over 270 bird species, including five endemic species found only in the East African coastal forests: the critically endangered Sokoke Scops Owl (Africa's rarest owl), Clarke's Weaver (one of Kenya's most endangered birds), Sokoke Pipit, Amani Sunbird, and East Coast Akalat. Budget travelers can hire local guides for $25/day (far more affordable than official rates) and stay at Gede Ruins Camp for budget-friendly accommodation. The forest contains three distinct habitat types - mixed forest, Brachystegia woodland, and Cynometra forest - each supporting unique wildlife. Beyond birds, visitors may spot Aders' duiker, golden-rumped elephant shrew, and the elusive Sokoke bushy-tailed mongoose. The best time for birdwatching is October to April when migrants arrive. Located adjacent to the ancient Gedi Ruins, visitors can easily combine forest exploration with historical site visits. Important: Carry Kenyan shillings as many services only accept cash.",
