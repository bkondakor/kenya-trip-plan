  "fullDescription": "Lake Naivasha is a stunning freshwater lake nestled in the Great Rift Valley at 1,884 meters elevation, just 90 kilometers northwest of Nairobi. Unlike many Rift Valley lakes, Naivasha's fresh water supports a completely different ecosystem, creating a verdant oasis teeming with wildlife and birdlife. The lake supports over 400 bird species, making it one of Kenya's premier birding destinations. The papyrus-fringed shores harbor one of East Africa's largest hippo populations. What sets Lake Naivasha apart is Crescent Island, a private sanctuary where visitors can walk freely among zebras, wildebeests, giraffes, and waterbucks without fences or vehicles - an extraordinarily rare experience in Kenya. The lake's proximity to Nairobi and adjacent Hell's Gate National Park makes it an ideal weekend escape.",
