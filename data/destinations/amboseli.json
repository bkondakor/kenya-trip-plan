  "fullDescription": "Amboseli National Park, situated at the foot of Africa's highest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro, offers one of the most iconic safari experiences in Kenya. The park's name comes from the Maasai word 'Empusel,' meaning 'salty dust,' referring to the dry lake bed that dominates the landscape during dry seasons. The park is world-renowned for its large elephant herds, often numbering over 1,000 individuals. These magnificent creatures can be photographed against the stunning backdrop of snow-capped Kilimanjaro, creating Africa's most recognizable safari image. The elephants of Amboseli have been studied continuously since 1972, making this one of the longest-running wildlife research projects in the world. Beyond elephants, Amboseli hosts over 400 bird species, including numerous waterbirds in the swamps fed by Kilimanjaro's melting snows. The park's diverse habitats support lions, cheetahs, buffalo, and rare opportunities to spot all of Africa's Big Five.",
