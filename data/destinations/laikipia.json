  "fullDescription": "The Laikipia Plateau represents Kenya's second-largest wildlife area, yet receives less than 10% of Masai Mara's visitor numbers. Lewa Wildlife Conservancy stands as the crown jewel, protecting over 200 black and white rhinos. Founded by the Craig family in 1983, Lewa pioneered the community-based conservation model, channeling 40% of revenues directly to surrounding communities for healthcare, education, and water projects. With only three lodges across 65,000 acres, you'll experience game drives with minimal vehicle congestion. Activities include horseback safaris with 40+ horses at Lewa Wilderness, vintage biplane flights in a 1929 WACO, camel trekking, and guided walks with Maasai trackers.",
