  "fullDescription": "Tsavo National Parks, divided into Tsavo East and Tsavo West, together form one of the world's largest wildlife sanctuaries covering nearly 22,000 square kilometers. This vast wilderness represents one of Africa's last great untamed frontiers where wildlife roams across seemingly endless horizons. Tsavo is world-famous for its legendary 'red elephants' - so named because they dust-bathe in the park's distinctive red volcanic soil. With over 12,000 elephants, Tsavo hosts Kenya's largest elephant population. Tsavo East features vast, flat, semi-arid plains dotted with baobab trees, while Tsavo West showcases more varied topography including the stunning Mzima Springs, volcanic landscapes, and the dramatic Sheitani lava flows. Together, these parks offer an authentic wilderness experience with fewer crowds than Kenya's more famous reserves, allowing visitors to experience the raw, untamed beauty of Africa.",
