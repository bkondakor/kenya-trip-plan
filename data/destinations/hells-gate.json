  "fullDescription": "Hell's Gate National Park is one of Kenya's most unique and adventurous destinations. Named for the intense geothermal activity beneath its surface, this 68-square-kilometer park is the only Kenyan national park where visitors can walk, cycle, and rock climb freely among wildlife. The park's dramatic landscape of towering red cliffs, volcanic rock formations, and geothermal steam vents inspired the scenery in Disney's 'The Lion King.' The two massive red-tinged cliffs forming the 'Hell's Gate' gorge rise dramatically from the valley floor, while Fischer's Tower and Central Tower provide world-class rock climbing routes. The narrow Hell's Gate Gorge, with its towering walls and naturally-heated springs, offers an unforgettable hiking experience through water-carved passages barely three meters wide.",
